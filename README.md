Books are a great source of inspirations to people. Readers are searching for better books and organizations like online book stores, government organizations are curious in understanding users interest and opinions. Book reviews in the form of text and rating are a good source of informative data that can be used for research. Our work in this research is deeply focused in understanding book reviews through text reviews and star ratings given to the book by readers.

Our research contributes in understanding the dynamics of book reviews that can be useful for academic institutions, writers, readers, online book stores, governments organizations.
